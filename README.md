# h√ºis (pronounced "who is") - a people list built in angular

### Goals

Since I'm bad at remembering people's names, I thought it would be good to have a company directory that has everyone's names and faces so if I forget someone's name I can find them.

I'm using this project to demonstrate skills in angular, so it will include the following:

* MVC patterns - templates, data bindings, etc, etc
* Built in directives (ng-show, etc)
* Custom directives
* Tests
* Forms
* Reading and writing from a REST service
* Routing and multiple views (with ui-router)
* CSS animations

### Setup
